Jackdaw is a simple API for creating graphical applications with Clojure.

Except it's not yet because graphics in Java is like drawing blood out of a stone.


Todo:

* Define box model (based on HTML like Shoes)
* Figure out basic algorithm for positioning and drawing, and so it can be reused by various block-level elements
* Flows should position sets of items horizontally
* Stacks should position them vertically

At the moment, only stacks with padding work.  Block-level items like text and buttons should be positioned based on size then padding and margin
